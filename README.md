# jirawkreader

Fow now, this is a XML parser that retrieves information from a Jira workflow.xml file and generate a representational image without needing to import it on Jira

In the future it may become an web application with visual elements :)

In order to run this prototype, clone this repos and enter the folder.
Then, run the following code:
```
python run main1.go
```
